Analyses App Store data to explore app features, user behaviour and performance metrics, potentially using predictive models for classification or insights.

# Project Objective's

- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Clean the dataset by replacing missing or NaN values in both numerical and categorical columns, ensuring data integrity for further analysis.
- Standardization and Normalization: Apply data standardization and normalization techniques to rescale features, reduce data redundancy, and improve the performance of machine learning models.
- Data Visualization: Use various visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to explore data distribution, detect outliers, and understand relationships between variables.
- Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing: Perform hypothesis testing and correlation analysis to validate assumptions about the dataset and investigate the strength of relationships between key app features and user ratings.
